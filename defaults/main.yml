# defaults file for pass
# Please see the `Available Installation Methods` section above
pass_install_method: distro_package

# Options:
# - `present` ensures that pass is installed
# - `absent` ensures that pass is not installed. This does not remove
# dependencies that are installed when `pass_install_method=source` to avoid
# removing packages that you installed prior to running this role.
pass_state: "present"

# Pass has the ability to copy passwords to your system clipboard using the `-c`
# option of the `pass show` command. By default, this role installs `xclip`, the
# clipboard helper for Xorg. If you are using Wayland, change this value to
# `wl-clipboard`. If you would like to install both `xclip` and `wl-clipboard`,
# change this value to `both`.
pass_clipboard_helper: xclip

# These Variables only apply when `pass_install_method=source`.

# Where to download and extract the Pass source tarball.
pass_download_path: /opt/pass

# Which version of Pass to install.
# When set to latest, this role will determine the latest version
# and install that.
pass_version: latest
# pass_version: 1.7.4

# Parameters to pass to make. Please see the [installation instructions][1] and
# [Makefile][2] in Pass's Git repository for all available parameters.
pass_make_params:
  # You can remove this value to install Pass to the default location, /usr/bin.
  # However, I recommend keeping this role's default which follows the Filesystem
  # Hierarchy Standard[3] and avoids conflicting with the system package manager.
  PREFIX: /usr/local  # Install pass to /usr/local/bin
